## FPL Predictor
---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas still sorting)  
- **Data source**: cleaned, matchday-updated player stats from  [vaastav Fantasy Premier League](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League)
- (still working) **Streamlit** or **Tableau/Power BI** for visualization  

---

## üìä Example Workflow
1. Load latest player dataset  
2. Add calculated columns: form, PPM, fixture difficulty 
3. Rank players in each position  
4. Optimize to select the best 15-man squad within budget  
5. Output: recommended team + top player picks hopefully

## ‚úÖ To-Do
- [ ] Load and explore dataset  
- [ ] Add form and fixture difficulty metrics  
- [ ] Implement PPM (Points Per Million)  
- [ ] Create ranking by position  
- [ ] Implement basic team selection (greedy approach)  
- [ ] Add optimization (knapsack problem)  
- [ ] Visualize results (dashboard or app)

## üìñ Learning Goals
- Practice Python data analysis with a real dataset  
- Learn about optimization problems and constraints  
- Apply sports analytics to something fun and personal  
- Build a portfolio-worthy project

## üìå Notes
- This is a **learning project**. Predictions may not always be accurate.  
- Processing is kept lightweight (using season data instead of large historical datasets).  
- Inspired by my love of football + desire to improve at FPL.
